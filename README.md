TURTLE CROSSING ROAD
The Turtle Crossing Game is a fun and simple Python-based game created using the Turtle Graphics library.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.The Player class controls the turtle's movement and tracks when it reaches the finish line.
2.The CarManager class is responsible for creating and moving the cars, and it adjusts the game difficulty by speeding up the cars after each successful crossing.
3.The Scoreboard class keeps track of the player's level and shows a "Game Over" message when a collision occurs.

FEATURES:
-Simple Controls: The player controls the turtle using the Up Arrow key.
-Increasing Difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as the player progresses to higher levels.
-Collision Detection: The game ends when the turtle collides with a car.
-Scoreboard: The player's current level is displayed at the top of the screen.
